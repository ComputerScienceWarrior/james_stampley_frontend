export const aboutMeText = "Hey there! I’m a passionate software engineer, problem solver, and father — and those are the three things that truly define me. My career path started with a love for tackling tough challenges and finding creative solutions. Whether it’s a complex coding problem or a tricky puzzle in life, I thrive on solving what others might consider “unsolvable.” As a father, I find my greatest drive in shaping a better future — not just through code, but through life itself. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing chess with a focus and determination that mirrors my professional mindset, or chasing my kids around the park, always seeking ways to stay active and engaged. I’ve explored different creative avenues, including sound engineering, but it was software development that truly clicked for me. Now, I focus on creating meaningful digital products that are high in quality and accessible to all. My goal is simple: to build affordable, top-notch software that empowers people without breaking the bank. Recently, I’ve ventured into running my own software engineering business, developing a variety of software solutions aimed at making life easier and more enjoyable for everyday users. It’s still early days, but I’m excited to see where this journey takes me.";
